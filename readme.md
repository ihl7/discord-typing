# Discord Typing Bot

This is a simple Python script that uses the Discord API to send a "typing" indicator to a specific Discord channel every 5 seconds. The script is designed to run as a bot, and requires a Discord API token to authenticate requests.

## Installation

To use this script, you will need to have Python 3.x and `pip` installed on your system. You will also need to install the `requests` library by running the following command in your terminal:

  ```pip install requests```
  
  
## Configuration

Before running the script, you will need to obtain a Discord API token 

You will also need to specify the ID of the channel that you want the bot to send the "typing" indicator to. You can find the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel name in Discord and selecting "Copy ID".

## Usage

To start the bot, simply run the `typing_bot.py` script in your terminal using the following command:

```python typing_bot.py```


The bot will then begin sending the "typing" indicator to the specified channel every 5 seconds. To stop the bot, simply press `Ctrl-C` in your terminal.
